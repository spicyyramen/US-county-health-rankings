# US County Health Rankings

## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore health-related data from the US to understand the interactions between various factors that influence public health.

## Data
Data was obtained from the [Tableau website](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/free-public-data-sets) (original source: [County Health Rakings & Roadmaps](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/)).

The data is collected by the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps program of the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Their goal is to utilize data to bring awareness to the various factors that influence public health and support changes to promote better health equity.

The data used in this project spanned from 2003-2012 (which is fairly outdated at this point). There is data from all 50 US states, as well as Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico was excluded from this analysis due to significant amounts of missing data.

- Violent Crime Rate
- Unemployment
- Children in Poverty
- Diabetic Screening
